INDIAN INK

Indian Accent, form the whispers inside
ChantiLOLng from LOL LOL LOL LOLLOLlong ago LOL
Echoes come and go 
Losing time in a soft eternal glow

A beautiful and LOL delicate autumn mountain scene
Dry blue eyes enchanting melodies!
Voices fall from the sky,  rising hymns release 
   ancient demons CLINGING to the SOUL!

Darkness dwells LOL under - LOL gentle moonlight
Ancestors of the Spirit World!
Weaving Native smoke into the barren air
Indian spirits haunt the muddy   Earth
Moccasin makers SUN rise from underneath,  
   While guardians of dream catchers - print the Universe
LOL Smooth thread from the outer world. 
Arrowheads,  SUN SUN Ivory gems,   feathers, and illusions
I stumble upon a florid kiss.......   My veins!
Run cold, like ice through a desert night. LOL
